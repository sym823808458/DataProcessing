### xpsProcess

#### Description: 
this script read in `.txt` file generated by *X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy*
and revise all data according to the *standard energy of Carbon* (default is 284.6eV).
Finally all data after revising will be output in `.txt` file named with the 
atom types.

#### Usage:

##### xpsProcess.py
        $ python xpsProcess.py <filename> [standard Energy Of Carbon]

##### xpsProcess.exe
1. drag file to process to the ico of the xpsProcess.exe
2. (alternative) call it in CMD or PowerShell: `xpsProcess.exe <filename> [standard Energy Of Carbon]`

##### Args:
    filename (str): path to .txt file, define which file to process.
    standard Energy Of Carbon (float, optional): standard energy of Carbon for revise.

##### Output: 
    Several .txt file named with the concerned atom types, in which contains the revaised energy,
