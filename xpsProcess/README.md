### xpsProcess

#### Description: 
    This script read in .txt file generated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
    and revise all data according to the standard energy of Carbon (default is 284.6eV).
    Finally all data after revising will be will be plot and 
    output in .txt file named with the atom types.

#### Usage:

##### xpsProcess.py
        $ python xpsProcess.py <file2Process> [standardEnergyOfCarbon]

##### xpsProcess.exe
1. drag file to process to the ico of the xpsProcess.exe
2. (alternative) call it in CMD or PowerShell: `xpsProcess.exe <filename> [standard Energy Of Carbon]`

##### Args:
    file2Process (str): path to .txt file, define which file to process.
    standardEnergyOfCarbon (float, optional): standard energy of Carbon for revise. default is 284.6eV.

##### Output: 
    Figure for each atom spectrum and save in .png files.
    Several .txt files named with the concerned atom types, in which contains the revaised energy, 
    counts and the original energy.
